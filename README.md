# 🩺 UrticaScan AI – Dermatographia Urticaria Detection System

UrticaScan AI is an AI-powered web application that detects **Dermatographia Urticaria**, a rare skin condition, using deep learning. The system classifies uploaded skin images, segments affected regions, and provides a downloadable report and treatment suggestions.

## 📖 What is Dermatographia?

**Dermatographia**, also known as *skin writing*, is a form of physical urticaria where light scratching leads to red, raised welts or hives. It affects about 2–5% of people globally and may be triggered by stress, infections, allergens, or unknown causes.

This project aims to provide an AI-based early screening tool to help individuals and dermatologists identify and monitor symptoms efficiently.

## 🧬 Classes of Skin Disease Detected

The system classifies skin conditions into:

- ✅ **Normal Skin** – No noticeable reaction or inflammation.
- ⚠️ **Mild Dermatographia** – Temporary raised lines, often fade quickly.
- ❗ **Severe Dermatographia** – Persistent welts or strong inflammatory reaction to pressure.

The segmentation module pinpoints affected areas to visually assist diagnosis.
