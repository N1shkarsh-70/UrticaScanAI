Educate about preventing reinfection and environmental control."
Tinea Candidiasis and Other Fungal Infections,Severe,"Prolonged systemic antifungal therapy under specialist supervision. Laboratory testing to identify fungal species and antifungal susceptibility. Evaluate and manage underlying immunosuppressive conditions (e.g., diabetes, HIV). Use adjunctive therapies like antiseptic washes to reduce fungal load. Follow up regularly to monitor treatment response and detect recurrences early."
Warts Molluscum and other Viral Infections,Mild,Apply over-the-counter salicylic acid preparations daily. Maintain good hygiene and avoid scratching to reduce spread.
